       "'Here\\'s an analysis of the provided prenuptial agreement, focusing on discrepancies and potential legal issues:\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nThis document is a prenuptial agreement between John Doe and Jane Doe, outlining their intentions to keep their premarital assets separate and defining property rights in the event of divorce or death. It includes disclosures of assets, waivers of certain marital rights, and provisions regarding separate and community property. The agreement also addresses issues related to children from previous marriages, income taxes, and dispute resolution through mediation and arbitration. The document specifies Texas law as governing and includes clauses for confidentiality, ratification, and the severability of invalid provisions.\\n\\n**Discrepancies:**\\n\\n*   **Missing Addresses:** The agreement states that John Doe resides at a specific address, but the address for Jane Doe is missing.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Insert Jane Doe\\'s full address.\\n\\n*   **Inconsistent Attorney Certifications:** The attorney certification section at the end of the document is duplicated. The first certification is for Jane Doe\\'s attorney, Duey Cheetum, and the second certification is for John Doe\\'s attorney, J. Mark Edgmon. However, the final page of the document contains the attorney certification for Jane Doe and John Doe.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Remove the duplicated attorney certification section at the end of the document.\\n\\n*   **Exhibit C Acknowledgments:** Exhibit C, the Ratification of Prenuptial Agreement, includes acknowledgment sections for both John and Jane Doe.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Remove the duplicated acknowledgment sections at the end of the document.\\n\\n*   **Exhibit C Attorney Certifications:** Exhibit C, the Ratification of Prenuptial Agreement, includes attorney certification sections for both John and Jane Doe.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Remove the duplicated attorney certification sections at the end of the document.\\n\\n*   **Incomplete Exhibit \"A\" and \"B\":** Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\" list assets but lack complete descriptions (e.g., account numbers are often partially obscured). While this might be intentional for privacy in this example, a fully enforceable agreement requires clear identification of assets.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Ensure complete and accurate descriptions of all assets are included in the final agreement.\\n\\n*   **Vague Language:** Some clauses use vague language (e.g., \"ordinary and customary living expenses\" in Section 3.16(b)).\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Replace vague terms with more specific definitions to avoid ambiguity.\\n\\n*   **Ratification Agreement:** The requirement to execute a Ratification Agreement after the marriage (Section 3.33) is unusual. While not necessarily invalid, it adds an extra step and potential point of contention.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Consider whether the Ratification Agreement is truly necessary or if the initial agreement can be made fully effective upon marriage.\\n\\n*   **Choice of Law:** While the agreement specifies Texas law, it also states it\\'s enforceable in any state where the parties are domiciled (Section 3.28(c)). This could create conflicts if the parties move to a state with different marital property laws.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Clarify that Texas law governs regardless of the parties\\' domicile, to the extent permitted by law.\\n\\n*   **Arbitration Clause:** The arbitration clause (Section 3.34) could be problematic if it doesn\\'t comply with the specific requirements of Texas law for arbitration agreements, particularly regarding waivers of legal rights.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Ensure the arbitration clause is drafted in strict compliance with Texas Family Code § 6.601 and § 153.0071, and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 171.001 et seq.\\n\\n*   **Lack of Specificity Regarding Separate Property:** While the agreement states the intention to keep separate property separate, it lacks detailed provisions for tracing separate property if it\\'s commingled with community property.\\n    *   **Suggested Correction:** Include specific provisions for tracing separate property, such as requiring detailed records of separate property transactions.\\n\\n**Draft:**\\n\\nGiven the nature of the document, a draft complaint or motion is not directly applicable. However, a potential motion related to this agreement could arise during a divorce proceeding. Here\\'s a draft motion to enforce the prenuptial agreement:\\n\\n**MOTION TO ENFORCE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT**\\n\\n**Introduction**\\n\\nComes now, [Party Name], and files this Motion to Enforce Prenuptial Agreement, and in support thereof, would show the Court the following:\\n\\n**Parties**\\n\\n1.  Movant, [Party Name], is a party to the above-styled and numbered cause.\\n2.  Respondent, [Other Party Name], is a party to the above-styled and numbered cause.\\n\\n**Jurisdiction and Venue**\\n\\nThis Court has jurisdiction over this matter, and venue is proper in [County Name] County, Texas.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nOn [Date of Prenuptial Agreement], Movant and Respondent entered into a valid and enforceable Prenuptial Agreement (the \"Agreement\"). A true and correct copy of the Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The parties subsequently married on [Date of Marriage]. The Agreement governs the disposition of property in the event of divorce.\\n\\n**Claims**\\n\\n1.  The Agreement is valid and enforceable under Texas law.\\n2.  The Agreement clearly defines the separate property of each party.\\n3.  Respondent has taken a position inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement regarding the characterization and division of property.\\n4.  Movant is entitled to specific performance of the Agreement.\\n\\n**Prayer for Relief**\\n\\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Movant prays that the Court:\\n\\n1.  Enter an order declaring the Prenuptial Agreement to be valid and enforceable.\\n2.  Order the division of property in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.\\n3.  Grant such other and further relief to which Movant may be justly entitled.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\n[Attorney Name]\\n[Attorney Bar Number]\\n[Law Firm]\\n[Contact Information]\\n'"
